# CODEOWNERS file for TCL-75 Smart Shopping List
#
# What is this file?
# This file helps automate the code review process by automatically assigning reviewers
# to pull requests (PRs) and setting rules for PR approvals.
#
# How does it work?
# 1. Automatic Reviewer Assignment:
#    - When a PR is opened, GitHub automatically assigns the mentors listed below as reviewers.
#
# 2. Review Requirements (set in GitHub branch protection rules, not in this file):
#    - Each PR needs at least 3 approvals to be merged:
#      a) 2 approvals from peer developers
#      b) 1 approval from a mentor (automatically assigned by this file)
#
# 3. Mentor Approval:
#    - At least one of the mentors listed below MUST approve the PR before it can be merged.
#    - This ensures experienced oversight on all code changes.
#
# How to request reviews:
# 1. In GitHub:
#    - When opening a PR, manually request reviews from 2 peer developers.
#    - Mentors will be automatically assigned as reviewers.
#
# 2. In Slack:
#    - Use the following Slack reacji to notify team members:
#      a) :todo-tcl75-devs: - This will ping developers for a review
#      b) :todo-tcl75-mentors: - This will ping mentors for a review
#    - Using these reacji helps communicate review needs efficiently to the team
#
# Best Practice:
# - Use both GitHub assignment and Slack notifications to ensure visibility and prompt reviews.
